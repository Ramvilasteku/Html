            Hockey</a>
        <p>Hockey is a term used to denote a family of various types of both summer and winter team sports which
            originated on either an outdoor field, sheet of ice, or dry floor such as in a gymnasium. While these sports
            vary in specific rules, numbers of players, apparel, and playing surface, they share broad characteristics
            of two opposing teams using a stick to propel a ball or disk into a goal.</p>

            Volleyball</a>
        <p>Volleyball is a team sport in which two teams of six players are separated by a net. Each team tries to score
            points by grounding a ball on the other team's court under organized rules.[1] It has been a part of the
            official program of the Summer Olympic Games since Tokyo 1964. Beach volleyball was introduced to the
            programme at the Atlanta 1996 Summer Olympics. The adapted version of volleyball at the Summer Paralympic
            Games is sitting volleyball.</p>

        <p>Kabaddi (/kəˈbædi/,[2] /ˈkʌbədi/)[3] is a contact team sport played between two teams of seven players,
            originating in ancient India.[4] The objective of the game is for a single player on offence, referred to as
            a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of the court, touch out as many of their players as
            possible, and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders in 30
            seconds. Points are scored for each player tagged by the raider, while the opposing team earns a point for
            stopping the raider. Players are taken out of the game if they are touched or tackled, but return to the
            game after each point scored by their team from a tag or tackle.</p>

            Cricket</a>
        <p>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game that is played between two teams of eleven players on a field, at the centre
            of which is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on
            three stumps. Two players from the batting team (the striker and nonstriker) stand in front of either wicket
            holding bats, with one player from the fielding team (the bowler) bowling the ball towards the striker's
            wicket from the opposite end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball with the bat and
            then switch places with the nonstriker, with the batting team scoring one run for each exchange. Runs are
            also scored when the ball reaches or crosses the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ludo">Ludo game</a>
        <p>Special areas of the Ludo board are typically coloured bright yellow, green, red, and blue. Each player is
            assigned a colour and has four tokens[c] in their colour. The board is normally square with a cross-shaped
            playspace, with each arm of the cross having three columns of squares, usually six per column. The middle
            columns usually have five squares coloured; these represent a player's home column. A sixth coloured square
            not on the home column is a player's starting square. At the centre of the board is a large finishing
            square, often composed of coloured triangles atop the players' home columns (thus depicting "arrows"
            pointing to the finish).</p>

        <p>Snakes and ladders is a board game for two or more players regarded today as a worldwide classic.[1] The game
            originated in ancient India as Moksha Patam, and was brought to the United Kingdom in the 1890s. It is
            played on a game board with numbered, gridded squares. A number of "ladders" and "snakes" are pictured on
            the board, each connecting two specific board squares. The object of the game is to navigate one's game
            piece, according to die rolls, from the start (bottom square) to the finish (top square), helped by climbing
            ladders but hindered by falling down snakes.
